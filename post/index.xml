      <description>In our preprint appearing on arXiv today, Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC, we use the two-loop amplitudes from Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders along with the real corrections to obtain differential cross sections of gluon-initiated diphoton-plus-jet production at NLO.</description>

      <description>To improve my teaching in higher education, I&amp;rsquo;m doing a course at Durham called Gateway to Academic Practice. It leads to the Durham Excellence in Learning and Teaching Award Level 1 and Associate Fellowship of Advance HE. It is aligned to Descriptor 1 of the UK Professional Standards Framework (which explains the following [AKV]\d). Here&amp;rsquo;s my account of professional practice (source), which I&amp;rsquo;ll submit for assessment.

      <description>My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit. Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my report (source). I then developed a Python simulation of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases. I wrote up the project in my dissertation (source). I also presented a poster (source) and defended the work in my viva with a presentation (source).</description>

      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer. This work was funded by the Laidlaw Undergraduate Programme in Research and Leadership.
 In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department.</description>

BEC Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well.
(Do you get the joke of the title? It is condensed and I am studying condensates! No, OK, it is not very funny…)
I have thoroughly enjoyed reading through all the posts before mine. Thank you all for sharing your experiences and in such excellent prose.</description>

      <description>This essay is also available as a pdf
I decided to enroll for the Professional Skills Curriculum (PSC) following advice from friends who had previously completed the course. They recommended it as a useful and informative experience in self-reflection and personal development. These are ideals I put effort into achieving, previously focussed by the Transferable Skills for Physicists module I took in Junior Honours. PSC provided me with a great opportunity to continue honing my professional skills with the guidance of its framework and access to its resources.</description>

      <description>Over the summer of 2015, I worked on my first research project with Brendon Lovett and Giuseppe Pica. We investigated the quadrupole interaction between donor electrons in a silicon substrate by computational simulation with a view to guiding experiments in quantum computation. I produced a Python code to do this. I presented a poster (source) and wrote a report (source) on the project.</description>

      <description>The module PH3014 Transferrable Skills for Physicists is a unique highlight of the St Andrews Physics Undergraduate programme. I had Paul Cruickshank as advisor for the module and enjoyed it greatly, developing my skills in oral and written communication and team work. In particular, I made good progress with my fear of public speaking.
The module includes a literature review project in which we produce a report on a topic and give a presentation on it at the wonderful Burn conference.</description>
