      <description>The time has come for my first year progress assessment. Here&amp;rsquo;s my report (source).
This draws together my studies of:
 Modern techniques in calculating scattering amplitudes (notes) Spinor helicity formalism (source) Colour algebra for squared amplitudes (notes) QCD corrections to the cross section of electron-positron annihilation to hadrons (source) (notes)  </description>

      <description>The module PH3014 Transferrable Skills for Physicists is a unique highlight of the St Andrews Physics Undergraduate programme. I had Paul Cruickshank as advisor for the module and enjoyed it greatly, developing my skills in oral and written communication and team work. In particular, I made good progress with my fear of public speaking.
The module includes a literature review project in which we produce a report on a topic and give a presentation on it at the wonderful Burn conference.</description>
