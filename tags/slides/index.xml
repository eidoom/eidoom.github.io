      <title>YTF20: introduction to precision QCD</title>

      <description>I was on the committee for the YTF 2019 and YTF 2020 conferences. For YTF20, I also gave a non-specialist talk on precision QCD. The talk is recorded (see below) and the slides are available here (source) (discussion of tech).

      <description>I attended the British Universities Summer School in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics (BUSSTEPP) 2019. We all gave a short presentation of our research. Here are my slides (source).</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetries in dual-mode Dicke models</title>

      <description>My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit. Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my report (source). I then developed a Python simulation of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases. I wrote up the project in my dissertation (source). I also presented a poster (source) and defended the work in my viva with a presentation (source).</description>

      <title>Polarisation in photon Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer. This work was funded by the Laidlaw Undergraduate Programme in Research and Leadership.
 In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department.</description>

      <description>The module PH3014 Transferrable Skills for Physicists is a unique highlight of the St Andrews Physics Undergraduate programme. I had Paul Cruickshank as advisor for the module and enjoyed it greatly, developing my skills in oral and written communication and team work. In particular, I made good progress with my fear of public speaking.
The module includes a literature review project in which we produce a report on a topic and give a presentation on it at the wonderful Burn conference.</description>
