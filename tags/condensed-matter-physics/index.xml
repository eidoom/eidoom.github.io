      <title>Continuous symmetries in dual-mode Dicke models</title>

      <description>My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit. Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my report (source). I then developed a Python simulation of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases. I wrote up the project in my dissertation (source). I also presented a poster (source) and defended the work in my viva with a presentation (source).</description>

      <title>Polarisation in photon Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer. This work was funded by the Laidlaw Undergraduate Programme in Research and Leadership.
 In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department.</description>

      <description>As part of the module PH3012 Thermal and Statistical Physics, we did a study of the one-dimensional tight-binding model of solid state physics. I wrote this report, with source.</description>

      <title>Modelling electron states in silicon-based quantum computers</title>

      <description>Over the summer of 2015, I worked on my first research project with Brendon Lovett and Giuseppe Pica. We investigated the quadrupole interaction between donor electrons in a silicon substrate by computational simulation with a view to guiding experiments in quantum computation. I produced a Python code to do this. I presented a poster (source) and wrote a report (source) on the project.</description>
