      <description>Our project n3jet_diphoton demonstrates the use of neural networks for high precision scattering amplitudes within Monte Carlo event generator simulations for hadronic colliders. We finalised the code today along with a preprint submission that will be listed on the arXiv tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today I released a new version of NJet. It includes all the feature contributions I have made to the NJet library over the last two years, including a couple of two-loop analytic amplitudes as well as some one-loop diphoton processes and a library of infrared limit functions.</description>

      <title>Outreach with a Galton board</title>

      <description>At the IPPP, I&amp;rsquo;m involved with the outreach programme. Aside from helping to run events, I also did a bit of maintenance on the Galton board exhibit, which I wrote about on our Computing Club website. In recent quarantined times, I experimented with a virtual version (source), which I discussed here.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetries in dual-mode Dicke models</title>

      <description>My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit. Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my report (source). I then developed a Python simulation of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases. I wrote up the project in my dissertation (source). I also presented a poster (source) and defended the work in my viva with a presentation (source).</description>

      <title>Polarisation in photon Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer.
In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department. I also continued work on the project, leading to a paper (arXiv).</description>

      <description>As part of the module PH3012 Thermal and Statistical Physics, we did a study of the one-dimensional tight-binding model of solid state physics. I wrote this report, with source.</description>
