      <description>I gave a talk in the IPPP internal seminar series about my recent work on diphoton-plus-jet production via gluon fusion, including:
 Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders Optimising simulations for diphoton production at hadron colliders using amplitude neural networks  Here are the slides (source).</description>

      <description>I gave a virtual talk at ACAT2021 (while I had COVID, actually) about our recent paper. Here are the slides (source) and a recording (below). Apologies for where the audio cuts out in the middle, but it&amp;rsquo;s really Zoom&amp;rsquo;s fault for not supporting Linux well.

      <description>I was on the committee for the YTF 2019 and YTF 2020 conferences. For YTF20, I also gave a non-specialist talk on precision QCD. The talk is recorded (see below) and the slides are available here (source) (discussion of tech).

      <description>I attended the British Universities Summer School in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics (BUSSTEPP) 2019. We all gave a short presentation of our research. Here are my slides (source).</description>
