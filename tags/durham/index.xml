      <description>I gave a virtual talk at ACAT2021 (while I had COVID, actually) about our recent paper. Here are the slides (source) and a recording (below). Apologies for where the audio cuts out in the middle, but it&amp;rsquo;s really Zoom&amp;rsquo;s fault for not supporting Linux well.

      <description>In our preprint appearing on arXiv today, Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC, we use the two-loop amplitudes from Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders along with the real corrections to obtain differential cross sections of gluon-initiated diphoton-plus-jet production at NLO.</description>

      <description>To improve my teaching in higher education, I&amp;rsquo;m doing a course at Durham called Gateway to Academic Practice. It leads to the Durham Excellence in Learning and Teaching Award Level 1 and Associate Fellowship of Advance HE. It is aligned to Descriptor 1 of the UK Professional Standards Framework (which explains the following [AKV]\d). Here&amp;rsquo;s my account of professional practice (source), which I&amp;rsquo;ll submit for assessment.
A2: Teaching and the Support of Learning This year I am a workshop demonstrator in level four Particle Theory for MPhys Theoretical Physics.</description>

      <description>With nine months to go, I had to write up a completion review (source) for my PhD. This was a good opportunity to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and sketch out the shape of my thesis.</description>

      <description>Our project n3jet_diphoton demonstrates the use of neural networks for high precision scattering amplitudes within Monte Carlo event generator simulations for hadronic colliders. We finalised the code today along with a preprint submission that will be listed on the arXiv tomorrow.</description>

      <description>Today I released a new version of NJet. It includes all the feature contributions I have made to the NJet library over the last two years, including a couple of two-loop analytic amplitudes as well as some one-loop diphoton processes and a library of infrared limit functions.</description>

      <description>At the IPPP, I&amp;rsquo;m involved with the outreach programme. Aside from helping to run events, I also did a bit of maintenance on the Galton board exhibit, which I wrote about on our Computing Club website. In recent quarantined times, I experimented with a virtual version (source), which I discussed here.</description>
