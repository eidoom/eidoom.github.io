      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer. This work was funded by the Laidlaw Undergraduate Programme in Research and Leadership.
 In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department.</description>
