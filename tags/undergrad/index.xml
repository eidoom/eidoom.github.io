BEC Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well.
(Do you get the joke of the title? It is condensed and I am studying condensates! No, OK, it is not very funny…)
I have thoroughly enjoyed reading through all the posts before mine. Thank you all for sharing your experiences and in such excellent prose. Everybody’s projects sound so interesting and I can feel the contagious enthusiasm in every post.</description>

      <description>The module PH3014 Transferrable Skills for Physicists is a unique highlight of the St Andrews Phsyics Undergraduate programme. I had Dr Paul Cruickshank as advisor for the module and enjoyed it greatly, developing my skills in oral and written communication and team work. In particular, I made good progress with my fear of public speaking.
The module includes a literature review project in which we produce a report on a topic and give a presentation on it at the wonderful Burn conference.</description>
