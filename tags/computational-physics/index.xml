      <description>I gave a virtual talk at ACAT2021 (while I had COVID, actually) about our recent paper. Here are the slides (source) and a recording (below). Apologies for where the audio cuts out in the middle, but it&amp;rsquo;s really Zoom&amp;rsquo;s fault for not supporting Linux well.

      <description>In our preprint appearing on arXiv today, Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC, we use the two-loop amplitudes from Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders along with the real corrections to obtain differential cross sections of gluon-initiated diphoton-plus-jet production at NLO.</description>

      <description>Today the preprint of our article Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders appeared on arXiv, in which we compute the two-loop gluon fusion to diphoton plus jet amplitude, providing it ready for phenomenological application in an accompanying NJet release.</description>

      <title>YTF20: introduction to precision QCD</title>

      <description>I was on the committee for the YTF 2019 and YTF 2020 conferences. For YTF20, I also gave a non-specialist talk on precision QCD. The talk is recorded (see below) and the slides are available here (source) (discussion of tech).

      <title>Continuous symmetries in dual-mode Dicke models</title>
      <link>https://eidoom.github.io/post/dicke-proj/</link>

      <description>My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit. Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my report (source). I then developed a Python simulation of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases. I wrote up the project in my dissertation (source). I also presented a poster (source) and defended the work in my viva with a presentation (source).</description>

      <title>Polarisation in photon Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <guid>https://eidoom.github.io/post/bec-proj/</guid>
      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) and presented a poster (source) on the work at the end of the summer.
In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to fellow undergraduates in my department. I also continued work on the project, leading to a paper (arXiv).</description>
