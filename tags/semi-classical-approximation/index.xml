      <description>My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. I wrote a Python code to simulate the system for this study. I reported (source) on the work at the end of the summer.
In the next academic term, I gave a presentation (source) to undergraduates in my department. I also continued work on the project, leading to a paper (arXiv).</description>
